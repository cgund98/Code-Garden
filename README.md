# Code Garden

Code Garden is a coding education app that I started with a friend.  It is probably the biggest single project I have taken on, and also the one I have worked on the farthest.  

Most of the project I worked on alone, so the code is not documented or commented.  I apologize for any readers of it.

##### Disclaimer: I am NOT a professional web developer by any means. Most of the project was learning as I went, and I did the best I could as I went through.

If anyone wants to contribute or offer suggestions, please contact me at [gundlachcallum@gmail.com](mailto:gundlachcallum@gmail.com)!
